# Handwritten Digit Recognition
This repository contains code for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The code is written in Python and demonstrates how to use various CNN to classify digits and also visualize the hidden layers.

## Features
- Handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset
- Streamlit app for visualizing hidden layers of CNN model and recognizing written digits.

## Usage
The Streamlit app provides a user interface where you can draw a digit and test it against the trained model. Simply draw a digit on the canvas and click the "Predict" button to see the predicted digit and confidence score for each of the trained models. The app works best on a desktop or as desktop site.


## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for a new feature, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Note
Since this app is not always in use, streamlit will place it in sleep mode and it might be hard to wake for reasons best known to them.
